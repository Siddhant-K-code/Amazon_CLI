# Amazon CLI
Ever had that moment when you’re coding and then you think Wait, I really need this Amazon thing, but are too lazy to navigate to Amazon? Well introducing:

This NodeJS project uses an Amazon Scraper to make getting Amazon products easy from the comfort of your console! No more waiting for Amazon to load, scrolling through the many distracting pages, then giving up. Simply select search features, your type of search, and your product name and get near-instant results.

## Functionalities :

* Set Your Country
* Set Product Category
* Search for Total Number of Product
* Search For Average price of product
* Search for Average Reviews of Product
* Search For Product URL (TOP - 5)
* View Your Current Settings
* View All Countries & Key Available 
* View All Categories

*I am in no way associated with Amazon, and this program is not an official Amazon project. Simply made for fun and only uses public data! I also don’t use any Amazon affiliation links, so I make no profit from this. Purely for Educational Purpose and You.*
